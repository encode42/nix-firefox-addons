# Nix Expressions For Firefox Addons

This flake provides over **130,000** addons from https://addons.mozilla.org/ as Nix packages. (with more being added every day)

A GitHub Action updates the list every day at 2:37am UTC. The fetcher script includes almost every addon that has as low as 1 daily user. If you happen to find an addon you'd like to have in this flake just download it once (getting its weekly downloads to 1) and it will be part of the next fetch.

## Declare Firefox Addons With [Home-Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)

### With Flakes
(it is assumed that Home Manager is set up)

1. Add this repository as an input to your flake

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    # ...
    nix-firefox-addons.url = "github:osipog/nix-firefox-addons";
  }
  # ...
}
```

2. Apply the overlay to your nixpkgs instance in your NixOS, nix-darwin or Home Manager configuration


```nix
{ inputs, ... }: {
  nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.nix-firefox-addons.overlays.default ];
  # rest of your configuration...
}
```


3. In your `home.nix` (or wherever you configured Firefox) add the desired addons (uBlock Origin as an example)

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  # ...
  programs.firefox = {
    enable = true;
    # ...
    profiles.default = {
      extensions = {
        packages = with pkgs.firefoxAddons; [
          ublock-origin
        ];
        # only works for some addons
        settings."uBlock0@raymondhill.net".settings = {
          selectedFilterLists = [
            "ublock-filters"
            "ublock-badware"
            "ublock-privacy"
            "ublock-unbreak"
            "ublock-quick-fixes"
          ];
        };
      };

      # optional: without this the addons need to be enabled manually after first install
      settings = {
        "extensions.autoDisableScopes" = 0;
      };
    }
  }
}
```

### Without Flakes

TODO

## Getting Addons

To find the package name (slug) and the addon ID (guid) of the addon you want to add to your config, you can use the `search-addon` command of this flake. It takes one argument which is a search query of the addon you are looking for and it returns a list with 10 matching addons with name, slug and guid.

```
nix run github:osipog/nix-firefox-addons#search-addon ublock
```

## Inspiration

- [rycee's NUR expressions](https://gitlab.com/rycee/nur-expressions) containing expressions for Firefox addons
- [montchr's firefox-addons](https://github.com/seadome/firefox-addons) also containing Nix expressions for Firefox addons
- [VSCode extensions Nix expressions by nix-community](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-vscode-extensions) as a rolemodel of scale
